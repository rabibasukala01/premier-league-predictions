### How it was done
1. Starting from web scrapping from the <a href="https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats">website-fbref.com</a> including team names of each season and each team data table from 2014 to 2024
You can look into bs4 code [here](https://github.com/rabibasukala01/premier-league-predictions/blob/main/PRE-PREDICT/scraping.ipynb).</br>
2. The EDA part and model making part is in [here](https://github.com/rabibasukala01/premier-league-predictions/blob/main/PRE-PREDICT/main.ipynb).
3. GradientBoostingClassifier remain high accuracy among others classifier with hyperparameter Tunings
4. Only 7 feature is used so it might be reason for only 66% accuracy or am i wrong? pull requests are welcome  

 If it helped you in anyway ,please do ‚≠ê the repository.
